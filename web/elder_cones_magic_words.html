				You evoke magic by combining Magic Words into the name or description of a spell.
				When you cast a spell, suggest an effect. The referee should help you work out the details, including any mechanics.
				Then, roll a number of d6s equal to the number of Magic Words used.
				<br>If the spell deals damage, this is how much.
				<br>For each die that rolls a 1, you must remove one Magic Word of your choice from your inventory.
			</p>
			<p>
				A Magic Word fills a Light Slot. A word is added to your inventory upon reading the Grimoire that contains it. This takes 1 hour and doesn't consume the Grimoire. Example words: MW Fire, MW Sphere, MW Summon.
				Magic Words are stem words, and you can change the ending. i.e. Fire â†’ Fires, Fired, Fiery.
				You can also insert linking words such as names (for the English Lit PhDs: articles, conjunctions, prepositions, and pronouns).
			</p>
			<p>
				Relative to the 1-9 spell level system, a magic word spell has the approximate power of a spell of a level equal to half the number of Magic Words used.
				<span id="fireball">"DISTANT ORB of FIRE YIELDS SERPENTINE SCARS."</span> = 6 Magic Words = Fireball (3rd level).
