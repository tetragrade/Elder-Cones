				<h2>Stats & Facets</h2>
				<div>
					<p>
						Assign stats and Facets, and decide your character's name, appearance, etc.
						<br>
						Your stats are Light & Flesh. You start with 4 Light, 4 Flesh, and 4 points to assign freely.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>
						Facets are descriptors of character's drives and talents. To compare them to something else: they're sort of like skills, or Fate's aspects.
						<br>
						You start with two Facets, both of die size d6.
					</p>
