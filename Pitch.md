Does anyone want to help playtest my system? It's an OSR system with a focus on uncovering untruths and exposing conspiracies. Playtest primer [here](https://tetragrade.github.io/Elder-Cones/web/elder_cones_char_options.html) (full doc is linked at the top).
I'll be running a dungeon that I designed for Cairn, converted for my system. The dungeon is an ancient ruin. It was once inhabited by an alien race, now a cult inhabits it, hoping to mimic the psionic powers of its builders. The cult activity is troubling the closest town, so several locals have asked you to get in there and sort out their issues.

Setting is vague science-fantasy. You're on the borderlands.
Location: #voice-chat + Whiteboard.


In town, you heard the troubles of three local magnates, all of which related to this location.
1. **Maria, Former Cultist.** Told you a sob story about her horrible experience at the cult: said their leader Crasmus was a lying charlatan, and that he tricked her associates into doing his bidding.
2. **High Priest Hargrave.** Was handing out vials of holy water during a zealous tirade against the Conic Cult. Yesterday, the cult stole the crucifix from the town church, injuring a servant in the process. Hargrave wants it back. Reward: free indulgence (one for each of you).
3. **Baron Borok.** Told you of a murderous bandit (Brad the Butcher), who has allegedly been seen near the dungeon. He claimed that Brad can be recognised by his stolen ruby ring (worth 75 days room and board). Reward: keep the ring + free lodgings at his castle.
