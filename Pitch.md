@One-Shot I'll be running a game on the <t:1729868400:f>.
It's small dungeon that I've designed for Cairn. The dungeon is an ancient ruin, which was once inhabited by an alien race. Now a cult inhabits it, hoping to mimic their psionic powers.

In town you learned of three quests, all of which lead to this dungeon.
1. **Selene the Psion.** Wants someone to bring her a psykonium shunt. She says they are small funnel-shaped spirals of glowing purple metal.
2. **Baron Borok.** Told you of a murderous bandit (Brad the Butcher), who has allegedly been seen near the dungeon. He claimed that Brad can be recognised by his stolen ruby ring (750 GP).
3. **High Priest Hargrave.** Was handing out vials of holy water during a zealous tirade against the Conic Cult. He wants you to use your vial to cleanse their unholy shrine.
Standard weird fantasy setting. You're on the borderlands, yadda yadda.
