Would anyone like to help playtest my system? You can view the rules [here](https://github.com/tetragrade/veracity-ttrpg/).
I'll be running a dungeon that I designed for Cairn, converted for Veracity. The dungeon is an ancient ruin, which was once inhabited by an alien race. Now a cult inhabits it, hoping to mimic their psionic powers.

In town, you heard the troubles of three local magnates, all of which related to this location.
1. **Selene the Psion.** Wants someone to bring her a psykonium shunt. She says they are small funnel-shaped spirals of glowing purple metal.
2. **Baron Borok.** Told you of a murderous bandit (Brad the Butcher), who has allegedly been seen near the dungeon. He claimed that Brad can be recognised by his stolen ruby ring (worth 75 days room and board).
3. **High Priest Hargrave.** Was handing out vials of holy water during a zealous tirade against the Conic Cult. He wants their unholy shrine cleansed in the name of his one true god.

A great storm is rolling in, and the seers say it'll last for at least a week.

Setting is vague science-fantasy. You're on the borderlands.
Location: #voice-chat + Whiteboard.
