		+ Misc Info: 
			+ Crasmus thinks they probably went home (very far) or died in the caves.
			+ They were killed by Brad the Butcher.
+ History.
	+ There was once an ancient race of cone-shaped monsters that lived underground (the conics). This was one of the gateways to the capital of the Ur-Cone Empire.
	+ It has since been overtaken by worshippers of Crasmus' Conic Cult.
		+ They believe general chaos stuff, survival of the fittest and all that.
		+ Furthermore, they believe that cones have special metaphysical properties and can grant hidden knowledge via mathematics. This was the power of the Ur-Cones.
		+ They use these secrets to transform into cones. Their leader Crasmus is a half-conic.
		+ They wear numbered masks, representing rank (wooden, green, obscure the face).
			1. Triangle Mask (master of arithmetic).
			2. Ball Mask (master of geometry).
			3. Cone Helmet (master of trigonometry).
		+ "God" is the number 3. Conics are π (bigger), so we should worship them instead.
		+ d4 cult chatter.
			1. Crasmus has a potion that will turn you into a cone. I'm going to win it.
			2. 3rd level cultist issued bizarre punishment (walk tightrope blindfolded).
			3. The conics will return soon. I had a dream where they spoke to me.<br>They said I have to trust Crasmus and make sure not to get leaves in his tea. 
			4. Lost my mask. So embarrassed. You're a sphere, right?
