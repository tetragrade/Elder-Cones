	1. 
		+ T: "The environment, you're standing at the edge of the forest, looking towards the shore. There's an area of rolling hills, not much vegetation, lots of rock outcroppings. The sea is choppy, and there's a storm on the horizon, you can see the lightning flickering across it. It's also raining a little here. Father Hargrave told you there were ancient ruins here, and indeed you can see a tower rising up by the coast. It was clearly build by the ancient Ur-Cone empire, you would've seen this sort of architecture in most major cities. The tower is made of amorphous stone, topped with a glass bubble. There's also a farmhouse nearby, smoke is rising from it so someone's clearly home."
		+ A: "We investigate the farmhouse, I walk up and knock on the door."
		+ 1-in-2, Brad's not home.
		+ T: "Ok, so as you approach, it becomes clear that the house is in disrepair. The thatch is mouldering, there's a little mushroom growing out of it. The whitewash is peeling too. The door looks pretty sturdy though. Still want to knock?"
		+ A: "Yeah."
		+ T: "So, you open the door, it doesn't appear to be locked or anything. Your first impression is that the room is very dirty, there's dirt and rubble, and erm, what else, and there're some spiderwebs in the corner. The whole room is filled by orange light from the roaring fire, and there's an uh, pot of stew on it. There are a few brightly-colored items arranged on the mantelpiece, and that's the only decoration in the room."
		+ B: "What's on the mantelpiece?"
		+ T: "So, there are a few items. There are a few green masks, a pink ribbon, and a child's doll. There are also a few other items, there's a sponge- Let me just read you the list\[reads off list from notes\]."
		+ C: "Ok, do I recognise the masks as belonging from a particular organisation?"
		+ T: "No."
		+ A: "Ok, are there any other doors?."
		+ T: "Yes, there's a doorway on the south wall, covered by a curtain."
		+ A: "We move through there."
		+ T: "In the next room, there's more of the same, dirty and dishevelled. It's dark in here but you can see a little by the firelight. It appears to be uninhabited. The far wall has collapsed, and leads to another room, but it's too dark to see anything. You can hear the faint sound of flowing and dripping water, echoing from ahead."
		+ C: "I light my torch and enter."
		+ T: "Ok, but remember, Alice is the caller. Your torch illuminates the room, nothing new to note. In the next room, you can now see there's a hole in the floor, where the floorboards have collapsed into a cave or something."
		+ A: "We walk over and look down into the hole."
		+ T: "Ok so it looks like it's a cylindrical vertical shaft, artificial with bricks, perhaps a well? There's a horrible smell, and you can see there's some kind of pool of water at the bottom that's reflecting your torch."
		+ B: "What's it smell like? Shit?"
		+ T: "Yeah sorta. Shit, but backed by a rotting smell as well. Like rotten meat."
		+ B: "Ugh, yuck. Should we climb down."
		+ A: "\[confers with group for a moment\] Yeah we climb down. Bob attaches his rope to the rafters and we slide down into the shaft." 
	2. 
		+ Turn # is even, so roll for encounter. 1-in-6: encounter occurs.
			+ 1 Crasmus.
			+ 2 Cultist (cone).
			+ 1 Cultist (sphere).
		+ T (thinking): "Ok, so the encounter is probably a cult punishment. They're dunking the sphere cultist in the cistern."
		+ T: "Ok, so you land in the water with a slight splash. You can hear someone coming down the passage to the north. They're very loud. You hear a commanding voice speak."
		+ T (as Crasmus): "Now! You shall be punished, for your crimes against our... Great endeavour. Three times thou shall dunk-ed in the filth, until thou are purified."
		+ T: "Ok so, whaddya do?"
		+ A: "Ok we try to hide in the water"
		+ T: "Alright uhh it's pretty gross. Give me a WIL save everyone."
		+ They fail the check.
		+ T: "Ok so, anyone want to have a go at describing why they fail?"
		+ A: "Yeah. Haha, I guess... My character has expensive armor, so maybe they're a noble, and they start arguing about how foul the idea is."
		+ T: "Right, ha. Yeah so the other group hears you. You can see a conical green creature approaching, it's hovering through the air. It has lots of legs curled up beneath it, and it's waving its four arms wildly, while shouting at you."
		+ T (as Crasmus): "Identify yourselves! Who has entered the domain of Crasmus the Acconed!?"
		+ T: "You see, three figures follow him up. Two of them, are carrying the third, grabbing his arms and dragging him. He's dragging his feet. The two that are holding him captive are wearing conical masks, and the captive is wearing a spherical one. Crasmus continues."
		+ T (as Crasmus): "If you have come seeking my genius, you have come at a bad time. We are delivering justice to one of our traitors."
		+ B: "This guy sounds like a chud."
		+ A: "Ok yeah we just attack them I guess."
		+ 
		+ Initiative:
			+ Alice.
			+ Crasmus. 8/16 HP, 10/10 STR.
			+ Cultist (cone) 1. 0/6 HP, 9/9 STR.
			+ ~~Cultist (cone) 2. 0/6 HP, 8/9 STR.
			+ Cultist (sphere) 2. 0/6 HP, 9/9 STR.
			+ Bob.
			+ Charlie.
		+ R1:
			+ A: "Ok so I just stab- Uh smack the cone guy. Crasmus. 1 damage."
			+ T: "Ok. So Crasmus psychokinetically throws you back up the shaft. So you land safely on the floorboards. He shouts: 'Seize them!'"
			+ T: "Cultist 1. Runs over and attacks Bob with his staff. 4 damage."
				+ Bob takes 4-1, 2/5 HP.
			+ T: "Cultist 2. Hits Charlie. 4 damage."
				+ Charlie takes 3-1, 3/6 HP.
			+ T: "The third cultist is still recovering from being dropped. Oh yeah I guess, these cultists are all at 0 HP cus they were carrying something."
			+ B: "Ok nice. I smack the cultist back. 1 damage..."
			+ T: "Ok, he has to save VS critical damage. 8, so he succeeds."
			+ C: "I attack him too. 6."
			+ T: "Ok, so we should've done those at once since you're attacking the same guy. My bad. You... Deal more, so it reduces his STR below 8, so he fails. The cultist falls down into the water, yelling in pain. She's out of the battle."
			+ A: "Ok now I jump down onto the cone guy."
			+ T: "Alright then, that's enhanced damage. d12"
			+ A: "8 damage! Yeah take that."
			+ T: "Ok, so he knocks you off and land safely on the ground. Then he attacks back, hitting with his clubs. 3 damage. No effect I guess. Finally, he shouts at the remaining cultists: 'You two, handle them, I will the fetch the others.' And floats off down the corridor."
			+ T: "The cone cultist screams 'Yes my overseer!', then continues to attach Charlie. 4 damage, that's all your HP right? Crit save."
			+ C: "Damn. "
